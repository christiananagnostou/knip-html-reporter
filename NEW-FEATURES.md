# New Features Summary

## 🎉 What's New

We've added several powerful interactive features to the knip-html-reporter that transform the static HTML report into a dynamic, interactive experience!

## ✨ Feature Highlights

### 1. 🔍 Interactive Search
**Real-time filtering across all content**

- Search box at the top of every report
- Instant results as you type
- Case-insensitive matching
- Searches through:
  - File paths
  - Issue types
  - Symbol names
  - All text content

**Example searches:**
- `src/components` - Find all issues in components folder
- `unused` - Find all unused items
- `.test.` - Find all test-related issues

### 2. 🏷️ Smart Filtering
**One-click issue type filtering**

- Filter buttons for each issue type present in your report
- Click multiple filters to combine them
- Works seamlessly with search
- Shows active filters with visual feedback

**Available filters:**
- Exports
- Dependencies
- Dev Dependencies
- Unlisted
- Unresolved
- Types
- Duplicates
- Enum Members
- Class Members
- And more!

### 3. 🔗 IDE Integration
**Open files directly from the report**

Two types of IDE buttons:
1. **File-level buttons** - Open the entire file (top right of each file section)
2. **Issue-level buttons** (⚡) - Jump directly to the line and column

**How it works:**
- Click ⚡ next to any issue
- File opens in VS Code
- Cursor positioned at exact line and column
- Start fixing immediately!

**Supported IDEs:**
- VS Code (out of the box)
- Cursor
- Other IDEs (configurable)

### 4. 📂 Collapsible Sections
**Better navigation for large reports**

- Click any file name to collapse/expand its issues
- Automatically expands when issues match filters
- Great for quickly scanning file names
- Improves performance with large reports

### 5. 🎨 Enhanced UI
**Modern, polished design**

- Hover effects on all interactive elements
- Visual feedback for active states
- Smooth transitions
- Responsive design for mobile
- "No results" message when filters match nothing
